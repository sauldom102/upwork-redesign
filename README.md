## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

1. Start the preparation script with `yarn starter`. This is very important to rename all references in project and it will reset the git log too.
2. Terminal will ask you for project name, type the project name and everything will be renamed to adapt the template to the new project
3. You can now use the project in another repository and start developing with all pre-installed dependencies, components and tools
4. Don't forget to **update all the dependencies before** starting to avoid breaking changes!
5. A new journey begins, good luck!
